## Rules of The Gerrymandering

If you're reading this before Gwarfs, sorry to ruin the magic but I did this to make it equitable and so that everyone would be happy and enjoy the Gwarfs. Here was my thought process for how this should go down.

1. Everyone should get at least one (1) award
2. If the award you won by vote is on the meaner side then you should by default get a second
3. There should be no outright sweeps
    - If there are, second most voted individual takes it
4. I am not eligible for any awards

### Let's get gerrymandering !

```{r, message= FALSE}
#import our libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(fuzzyjoin)
library(janitor)


#import our data
gwarfs_df <- read_csv("data/Gwarfs Data Cleaned.csv")

# lets do some text cleaning too
gwarfs <- gwarfs_df %>%
  mutate_all(funs(tolower))
gwarfs

```

## Data Analysis 

Doing some data wrangling on the results of the survey (as of 27/03/24)

The Superlatives are as follows:

### Party Foul Wrangling

```{r}

# so we've gotta wrangle our data to count effectively

# let's subset only that column

# then lets replace any istance of olivia with olivia kissing
foul_df$`Party Foul` <-
  ifelse(str_detect(foul_df$`Party Foul`, "olivia"), "olivia kissing", foul_df$`Party Foul`)

# then lets replace any istance of isaac with isaac yarf
foul_df$`Party Foul` <-
  ifelse(str_detect(foul_df$`Party Foul`, "isaac"), "isaac yarf", foul_df$`Party Foul`)

# then lets replace any istance of nora with nora puking on drew

### Harper Memories Wrangling

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Unused Code

```{r}

#   rename(superlative =  name) %>%
#   # group by superlatives, goes 1-19 for each response
#   group_by(value, superlative) %>%
#   # count if there's a name value associated with the superlative
#   count() %>%
#   # pivot it wider so each superlative has an associated count for each name submitted
#   pivot_wider(id_cols = superlative, names_from = value, values_from = n, values_fill = 0)
# gwarfs_winner
# 
# # woohoo! we've got a good table going baby
# 
# # caelan's name was spelt tons of different ways, let's try to clean this up
