## Rules of The Gerrymandering

If you're reading this before Gwarfs, sorry to ruin the magic but I did this to make it equitable and so that everyone would be happy and enjoy the Gwarfs. Here was my thought process for how this should go down.

1. Everyone should get at least one (1) award
2. If the award you won by vote is on the meaner side then you should by default get a second
3. There should be no outright sweeps
    - If there are, second most voted individual takes it
4. I am not eligible for any awards

### Let's get gerrymandering !

```{r }
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
